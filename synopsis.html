    <h1> Synopsis</h1>
    <h2 class="text-left"> As far as history goes, mass surveillance in the United States really started to ramp up during the Vietnam War in the mid 1970s.  The US government used wiretapping to spy on politically subversive groups and those who were against the war at the time.  The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) was established shortly after in October of 1978.  FISA details procedures for the collection of intelligence between foreign entities suspected of spying or terrorism.  FISA also created the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which is called FISC or the FISA Court.  FISC concerns warrants given out against spies within the country and can give out retroactive warrants against searches that have been already completed within the last 72 hours.  Mass surveillance policies, as well as the relative power of the NSA and FBI, stayed the same up until the September 11th attacks occurred.  This event obviously shook up the national intelligence community, and many people blamed the FBI and the NSA for not uncovering the terrorist plot.  These attacks greatly increased the power of these agencies, as well as bolstering security around the world.  Only one month after the attacks, the Patriot Act was passed, section 215 of which allowed for intelligence agencies to collect and intercept any tangible things as long as they pertained to anti-terrorism or foreign investigation.  In 2006 USA Today brought to light the fact that the NSA was collected phone records of millions of Americans compiled from Verizon, AT&T, and Bellsouth.  In 2012 two senators, Ron Wyden and Mark Udall, stated that most Americans would be shocked to see the extent of the Patriot Act, and there was a “major disconnect” between the American people and knowledge of these laws and programs.  By 2013 the NSA had become the largest domestic intelligence agency ever on the planet.   In 2013, Edward Snowden was able to shed some light on the NSA’s practices through his often questioned whistleblowing.  He held a TED Talk over video from Russia in 2014, detailing his efforts in a more digestible form.  He detailed three major NSA programs: PRISM, Project Bullrun, and BOUNDLESSINFORMANT.  PRISM is an NSA program concerning the collection of metadata of ordinary Americans, metadata being the information concerning who and where Americans talk to, when they talk, and for how long.  BOUNDLESSINFORMANT was a mapping of how many communications were being intercepted by the NSA by country, the top five countries being Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Jordan, and India in that order.  The US had around 3.1 billion interceptions while Pakistan had around 27 billion.  Project Bullrun made an effort to create backdoors in various corporations infrastructure for the NSA to later use.  Snowden had an overall message during his TED Talk of the importance of the protection of a free internet, that these programs had no real effort on terrorist efforts, and that the NSA is potentially deteriorating our democracy behind closed doors.  The deputy director of the NSA, Richard Ledgett, also had a TED Talk shortly after Snowden’s in order to share his point of view.  Ledgett stated that Snowden’s allegations were mainly half-truths and extrapolation, and that Snowden could have brought his problems up in a much better manner.  Ledgett claims that all 35,000 NSA employees have the best interests of the United States at heart, and that there are established measures in place that NSA employees can use to express their concerns, like talking to a supervisor.  Leggett thinks that Snowden is arrogant, and that the actions taken by Snowden have put Americans at risk.  Potential targets of the NSA will see that they are vulnerable to some of the disclosed programs, and thus adapt, diminishing the capabilities of the NSA.  He says that the internet is a great accomplishment of mankind, but that the NSA needs tools to track hostile entities.  He claims that the reason there hasn’t been another 9/11 is because of the NSA’s programs and efforts.  Ledgett claims that 54 terrorist incidents have been stopped by the NSA, and that nuclear and biological attacks are a real threat that we must protect ourselves against.  Looking at both sides of the conflict, we, as a people, must decide what we value most: the freedom and liberty of the internet, or national security at any cost.
