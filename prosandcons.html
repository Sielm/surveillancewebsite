            <li> The president has the constitutional right to conduct warrentless mass surveillance. </li>
            <li> We have to use any means to counter attacks potentially as devastating as 9/11. </li>
            <li> The NSA has little room for corruption due to its frequent reviews and reauthorizations. </li>
            <li> The fact that there hasn't been another 9/11 is not an accident. </li>
            <li> Terrorism and cyberthreats are large problems that need to be stopped by any means. </li>

            <li> Mass surveillance creates a lesser degree of privacy. </li>
            <li> The government already has more data than it could ever use. </li>
            <li> The "end" of mass surveillance is unknown. </li>
            <li> The threat of terrorism is an excuse.</li>
            <li> None of the NSA's risks have come to bear. </li>
            <li> The NSA has a worrying lack of transparency. </li>
